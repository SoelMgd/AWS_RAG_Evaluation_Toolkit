1. It fetches incidents or requests from the MMS (ServiceNow) system periodically.

2. Dictionaries are used to match MMS items with NinGines pipelines and automations. The dictionary contains details like the MMS item name, ID, automation name, and whether it is enabled or not.

3. When a matching MMS item is found, the corresponding automation defined in the GitLab project is triggered.

4. The automation is executed via jobs defined in the GitLab pipeline (automation.yml file). These jobs can perform various remediation actions.

5. The automation sets a predefined AUTOMATION_RESULT variable based on the outcome (success, failed, etc.), which updates the status of the MMS item accordingly.

6. Optionally, work notes or comments can be added to the MMS item based on the automation execution.

So in summary, NinGines acts as a bridge between MMS incidents/requests and GitLab pipelines, enabling automated remediation workflows to be executed and the MMS item status to be updated based on the automation result.","[{'source': 'cloud-services\\docs\\ningines\\03-interface\\02-incident-1-7.md', 'filename': 'cloud-services\\docs\\ningines\\03-interface\\02-incident-1-7.md'}, {'source': 'cloud-services\\docs\\ningines\\03-interface\\01-request-1-7.md', 'filename': 'cloud-services\\docs\\ningines\\03-interface\\01-request-1-7.md'}]",multi_context,

What you want is that the exact same patches are applied progressively to your environments for consistency sake and to avoid any bugs.\n\nWithout an Approval delay, pprd would be patched with patches that would have been released between the first and second Saturday, whereas Dev would have been patched with patched available 7 days earlier. Same goes for prod which will have 14 days of patch delta with pprd and 21 days with dev.\n\nIn that case, patch approval delay solves this by letting you choose an approval delay: 21 days for prod and 7 days for pprd will do the trick. This way, you are ensuring that the same patched are applied consistently and progressively across your environments.\n\nApplicable value in Patch Group tag Approval delay Recommendation D0 All patches Development, Sandbox D7 Only patches that are older than 7 days Preproduction, staging, QA D14 Only patches that are older than 14 days Preproduction, staging, QA D21 Only patches that are older than 21 days Production D28 Only patches that are older than 28 days Production\n\nPlease note that only those values are available by default in the solution.\n\nIf you don't deactivate the patching in a D7, D14 or D21 environment, then SSM will automatically apply the patches in due time.

To create a pipeline and execute jobs you simply have to create a pipeline configuration file, named .gitlab-ci.yml in the root folder of your project.\n\nHere is a very simple example of a job scanning CloudFormation templates for security purposes:\n\nChoose a runner\n\nTo use a shared runner, it is not necessary to indicate a tag. Any job without tag will be picked by a shared runner.\n\nTo use a Dedicated Runner, you must set a tag value specifying the tag name that has been given to you by GIO. This runner must be enabled for your project or the group in which your project resides.\n\nSpecify a GIO-managed container image\n\nYou can bring your own image, yet, we do recommend that you always use a GIO-provided base image to execute your job or to create a new container image that suits your needs. That way, you can benefit from all the setup already embedded in GIO base images such as certificates, tools properly configured, etc.\n\nTrigger a pipeline\n\nGitLab will automatically execute the jobs when a .gitlab-ci.yml file is present in the project at any push. Check the pipeline execution in the GitLab interface under ""Pipelines"" in the navigation side-panel of your project. You can also leverage Pipeline Schedules to schedule jobs.\n\nCI/CD snippets\n\nUse the provided samples to get started with CI/CD jobs in GitLab CI.

1. Projects in the SF have GitLab CI/CD enabled by default, allowing the creation of pipeline configuration files (.gitlab-ci.yml) to define jobs and automate processes.

2. The SF provides shared runners that can execute jobs without needing to specify a tag. Dedicated runners with specific tags can also be used for projects or groups.

3. The SF recommends using GIO-provided base container images to execute jobs or create new container images. These base images come pre-configured with certificates, tools, and other setups.

4. Pipelines are automatically triggered when a .gitlab-ci.yml file is present in the project and a commit is pushed. Pipeline schedules can also be leveraged to schedule jobs.

5. The SF provides CI/CD snippets and samples in a shared repository to help users get started with defining CI/CD jobs in the .gitlab-ci.yml file.

In summary, the SF leverages GitLab CI/CD, container images, and runners to automate software development life cycle processes by enabling users to define pipelines, jobs, and utilize pre-configured resources within the SF environment.","[{'source': 'cloud-services\\docs\\sf\\04-gitlab-ci\\01-quick-start.md', 'filename': 'cloud-services\\docs\\sf\\04-gitlab-ci\\01-quick-start.md'}]",multi_context,

So if key is not used for 71 days.\n\nSchedule\n\nThis automation is scheduled once a day, between 12h-13h UTC globally.\n\nHow it works\n\nAutomation proceeds as follows: - List all IAM User access keys deployed in the AWS account - For each key in the list: - Check for how many days key is not used - Check for how many days key was created - If key is not used for almost 40 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is not used for more than 40 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is created for almost 365 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is created for more that 365 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account (even if the key is used) - If key was deactivated for the first time 31 days ago: delete it\n\n:::tip\n\nThe automation will use the AWS API to deactivate or delete keys. If you have deployed it via CloudFormation, Terraform, etc. you may have a drift from your corresponding stack.\n\n:::\n\nHow to\n\nHow to configure the recipients of the warning emails\n\nTo be informed about events regarding your IAM User Access Keys (near expiration, deactivation, etc...), you can specify the recipients of the warning emails. Use the following available tags:\n\nTag Key Value gio:iamUser:owner A space separated list of up to 5 IAM User owner e-mail addresses → To recipients of mails. gio:iamUser:cc A space separated list of up to 5 IAM User owner e-mail addresses → Cc recipients of mails.\n\n:::caution\n\nThe tags are case sensitive\n\n:::\n\n:::info\n\nYou can find more detailed information regarding IAM Users here.\n\n:::\n\nHow to deploy a compliant IAM User\n\nYou may use the self-service solution ""IAM Users"" which deploys a simple IAM User compliant with cloud and Air Liquide security standards.\n\nGet Started with IAM User deployment\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy do we deactivate expired keys? An IAM User access key is a secret credential that can be used to access internal Air Liquide IT resources. The older this credential is, the more we have a risk of having it stolen/compromised. This is why we have an Air Liquide security golden rule regarding the age of those keys and the obligation to change/rotate it at least once a year.\n\nHow can I prevent this deactivation? By respecting the Air Liquide security policy, so changing/rotating your keys once a year no deactivation will occur as your keys will not reach the maximum time life of 1 year.\n\nWhat is the impact of this automatic deactivation? After deactivation of IAM User access key, the key is no longer usable. If you have a workload which uses the key, this workload will stop working just after deactivation.\n\nWill I receive a notification? If you are the AWS account owner, or if you are the IAM User owner, you will receive a mail to inform you about the deactivation with the reference of the deactivated key.\n\nI own an IAM User. Why am I not receiving any mail? It means the tags on IAM Users are not properly set up with your email address.']","The following email notifications are sent as part of the automation process for managing IAM User access keys:

These policies enforce various rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with our corporate standards and service level agreements. Azure Policy meets this need by evaluating your resources for non-compliance with assigned policies. All data stored by Azure Policy is encrypted at rest. For example, we can have a policy to allow only a certain SKU size of virtual machines in your environment. Once this policy is implemented, new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance. With the right type of policy, existing resources can be brought into compliance.\n\nThe Compliance Overview shows you the different level of compliancy with each policy linked to a specific subscription.\n\nA Policy should be a Definition, assigned on a specific resource or part of a specific Initiative. Each Policy definition match a specific need.\n\nExample:\n\nPolicy Definition ""Deny SQL Databases Editions"" deny the deployment of specific database edition as Hyperscale.

IAM User access keys must be rotated before they reach 365 days of age.)\n\nArchitecture\n\nAutomation sequence\n\nScope\n\nThis automation is executed: - into all Essential and Managed accounts - for all existing IAM Users\n\nAre excluded from the automation: - Lab Accounts - The AWS environments managed by Claranet for the HDS scope in Europe\n\nAre deactivated: - Keys not used from at least 40 days. - Keys created from at least 365 days.\n\nA deactivated key still appears in the IAM User Access Keys list but is not usable.\n\nAre deleted: - For expired keys: Keys deactivated 31 days ago, even if keys is reactivated in the meantime. So when the age of the key is 396 days old. - For non used keys: Keys deactivated 31 days ago except if key is reactivated and used again. So if key is not used for 71 days.\n\nSchedule\n\nThis automation is scheduled once a day, between 12h-13h UTC globally.\n\nHow it works\n\nAutomation proceeds as follows: - List all IAM User access keys deployed in the AWS account - For each key in the list: - Check for how many days key is not used - Check for how many days key was created - If key is not used for almost 40 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is not used for more than 40 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is created for almost 365 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account - If key is created for more that 365 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account (even if the key is used) - If key was deactivated for the first time 31 days ago: delete it\n\n:::tip\n\nThe automation will use the AWS API to deactivate or delete keys. If you have deployed it via CloudFormation, Terraform, etc. you may have a drift from your corresponding stack.\n\n:::\n\nHow to\n\nHow to configure the recipients of the warning emails\n\nTo be informed about events regarding your IAM User Access Keys (near expiration, deactivation, etc...), you can specify the recipients of the warning emails. Use the following available tags:\n\nTag Key Value gio:iamUser:owner A space separated list of up to 5 IAM User owner e-mail addresses → To recipients of mails. gio:iamUser:cc A space separated list of up to 5 IAM User owner e-mail addresses → Cc recipients of mails.\n\n:::caution\n\nThe tags are case sensitive\n\n:::\n\n:::info\n\nYou can find more detailed information regarding IAM Users here.\n\n:::\n\nHow to deploy a compliant IAM User\n\nYou may use the self-service solution ""IAM Users"" which deploys a simple IAM User compliant with cloud and Air Liquide security standards.\n\nGet Started with IAM User deployment\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy do we deactivate expired keys? An IAM User access key is a secret credential that can be used to access internal Air Liquide IT resources. The older this credential is, the more we have a risk of having it stolen/compromised. This is why we have an Air Liquide security golden rule regarding the age of those keys and the obligation to change/rotate it at least once a year.\n\nHow can I prevent this deactivation? By respecting the Air Liquide security policy, so changing/rotating your keys once a year no deactivation will occur as your keys will not reach the maximum time life of 1 year.\n\nWhat is the impact of this automatic deactivation? After deactivation of IAM User access key, the key is no longer usable. If you have a workload which uses the key, this workload will stop working just after deactivation.\n\nWill I receive a notification? If you are the AWS account owner, or if you are the IAM User owner, you will receive a mail to inform you about the deactivation with the reference of the deactivated key.\n\nI own an IAM User. Why am I not receiving any mail? It means the tags on IAM Users are not properly set up with your email address.', '\n\nHow it works\n\r\nAutomation proceeds as follows:\r\n- List all IAM User access keys deployed in the AWS account\r\n- For each key in the list:\r\n  - Check for how many days key is not used\r\n  - Check for how many days key was created\r\n  - If key is not used for almost 40 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account\r\n  - If key is not used for more than 40 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account\r\n  - If key is created for almost 365 days: send a warning email to owner of key and owner of AWS account\r\n  - If key is created for more that 365 days: deactivate the key and send an informational email to owner of key and owner of AWS account (**even if the key is used**)\r\n  - If key was deactivated for the first time 31 days ago: delete it\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\n\r\nThe automation will use the AWS API to deactivate or delete keys. If you have deployed it via CloudFormation, Terraform, etc. you may have a drift from your corresponding stack.\r\n\r\n:::\r\n\r\n']","The key lifecycle events that trigger notifications and actions in the IAM User key automation are: 1) Key not used for almost 40 days (warning email sent), 2) Key not used for more than 40 days (key deactivated and informational email sent), 3) Key created for almost 365 days (warning email sent), 4) Key created for more than 365 days (key deactivated and informational email sent, even if used), 5) Key deactivated for 31 days (key deleted).","[{'source': 'cloud-services\\docs\\aws-lab-essential\\04-landing-zone-references\\07-autom-ref\\01-iam-user-key.md', 'filename': 'cloud-services\\docs\\aws-lab-essential\\04-landing-zone-references\\07-autom-ref\\01-iam-user-key.md'}, {'file_path': 'c:\\Users\\soel.megdoud\\Documents\\RAG Air Liquide\\rag_cs\\cloud-services\\docs\\aws-lab-essential\\04-landing-zone-references\\07-autom-ref\\01-iam-user-key.md', 'file_name': '01-iam-user-key.md', 'file_size': 5074, 'creation_date': '2024-07-31', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-20'}]",multi_context,
