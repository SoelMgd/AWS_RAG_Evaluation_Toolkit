            "Here are some key points and best practices typically covered in secure coding guidelines for software development:\n\n- Use input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), etc. Validate all user input and sanitize output. \n\n- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL queries. This helps prevent SQL injection.\n\n- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks in the code to prevent broken access control issues.\n\n- Use encryption for sensitive data like passwords, credit cards, health information etc. Do not store or transmit plain text sensitive data.\n\n- Implement proper error and exception handling. Do not expose internal application details through errors and exceptions.\n\n- Use secure communication protocols like TLS for encryption and data integrity.\n\n- Adhere to principles like least privilege and fail-safe defaults in the code. Limit access and functionality to only what is absolutely necessary.\n\n- Avoid using banned or insecure API calls. Use the most updated secure libraries and frameworks.\n\n- Perform proper logging, auditing and input validation to prevent issues like path traversal, HTTP parameter pollution etc.\n\n- Follow security coding standards like OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, CWE/SANS Top 25 etc. during development.",

Note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the certificate in ACM. This ARN will be needed later when referencing the certificate in CloudFormation templates. \n\n4. Import the certificate into ACM.
