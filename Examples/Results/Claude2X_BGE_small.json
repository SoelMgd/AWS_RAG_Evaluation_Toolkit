Use role-based access controls and limit privileges to only what is absolutely necessary.\n\n- Handle errors securely - don't reveal sensitive error details to users that could aid an attack. Log errors securely and only show generic error messages to users.\n\n- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest. Use secure protocols like TLS for data in transit and encrypt data stored in databases or files. \n\n- Adhere to secure authentication best practices - don't store plain text passwords, implement password complexity rules, use secure password hashing, enforce regular password changes, etc.\n\n- Sanitize all data parsed from untrusted sources before using it. Validate schemas, sanitize inputs, use allow lists instead of deny lists, etc.\n\n- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Never dynamically build SQL queries with user input.\n\n- Implement appropriate logging and alerting to detect potential attacks or breaches. Log important events and monitor logs for anomalies.",

Their role is to help ensure Air Liquide is effectively leveraging AWS and getting the most out of their AWS Enterprise Support subscription.",

Upload your existing SSL/TLS certificate to AWS ACM. The context mentions following the official AWS ACM user guide for instructions on how to do this.\n\n3. Note down the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the certificate in ACM. This ARN will be needed later when referencing the certificate in CloudFormation templates. \n\n4. Import the certificate into ACM. This is also mentioned in the context as a key step.\n\nIn summary, the main steps are to create or upload a certificate into ACM, import it, and note down its ARN for future reference."
